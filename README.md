# SpendSmart

SpendSmart is a fullstack app designed to help users track their cash flow and create budgets in a convenient and efficient manner. With the rise of digital payments and online transactions, it can be difficult for an individual to keep track of their expenses manually. SmartSpend allows users to log their transactions and take control of their cash flow.

## How to run SpendSmart on your machine
### Get the code

Clone the repository, `cd` into it if necessary, and install the requirements (assuming you already have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your machine):
```shell
git clone https://github.com/geoffreyxu/CS35L-Group-Project.git
cd ./CS35L-Group-Project
npm install
```

### Run the app

In the root directory, simply run:
```bash
npm start
```
With this, the app should open in your browser in http://localhost:3000/. Note that it may take some time for npm to start the server. If it does not, enter http://localhost:3000/ into your browser and you should be good to go. Once the app has opened, you will need to create a SpendSmart account.
